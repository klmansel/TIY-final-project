# TIY-final-project

This is the final project for the Front End Engineering course at The Iron Yard Greenville, SC.

The concept is to create an app coaches can use to view visual graphs of their athlete's
 perfomances over time (week over week, season).
 
 The goal is to show improvements, top performers and areas for improvement at a glance.
 
 Coaches will need to manually enter athlete's results after building a database of athletes
 when logging into the app. 
 
 Results will be able to be sorted by athlete or team. 
 
 This project will include example data using a single team, season, and set of athlete's 
 from a specific team. 
 
 The sample app is showcased in the marketing app for a youth track and field team under the section 
 "Coaches Area"
